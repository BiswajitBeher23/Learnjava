_Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible._

_It is a compiled language and not an interpreted language. It is a concurrent language and not a sequential language._

_It is a strongly typed language and not a weakly typed language. It is a dynamically typed language and not a statically typed language._
